# measure-time-cost
Problem Statement goes below:

1.Measure the cost of a minimal function call in C/C++ (cost in terms of time taken). The minimal cost could be emulated by measuring a bare function call that neither takes any parameter nor does anything inside the function. ï‚·

2.Measure the cost of a minimal system call in C/C++. Unlike a regular function call, a system call traps into the operating system kernel. The minimal cost can be emulated by measuring the cost of getpid () which doesn't really do anything. 

3.Measure the cost of a read/write system call in C/C++. ( Hint : You can fork a child process and transfer one byte between parent and child) For the above measurements, you will need to repeat the experiment many times and then take the average.

You will need to use a high resolution timer, see here: http://linux.die.net/man/3/clock_gettime The goal is to have STABLE measurement results. You are encouraged to be innovative in designing your own test.
